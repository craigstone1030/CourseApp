================= Overview ==================
Dear clients!

If you're looking for a programmer who's an expert in python programming, I am glad you've come to the right place.

I have experience of working with nearly everything inside and outside of his field. 
All of my external ventures have had the pleasant effect of allowing me to make connections 
where most people don't even think to look, and make use of all of my skills to the best of my abilities.

Expertise:
- Python (2, 3x), FastAPI, Flask, Celery, asyncio, Django, multithreading/multiprocessing, pytest, unittest;
- Databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, ORMs (SQLAlchemy/Alembic, Django ORM
- Web: WebSockets, gunicorn, Nginx, a bit of JavaScript/CoffeeScript/Angular, HTML/CSS;
- DevOps: Terraforms, Kubernetes, Docker/docker-compose, Linux, deployed things to AWS, DigitalOcean and Heroku;
- Machine learning related: Pandas, NumPy, did an API around a TensorFlow model.
- Bots
- Selenium Tasks
- Web Scraping
- RESTful APIs
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) tasks

I tend to be extremely straight forward about what I can do and how long it might take me to do it. I know my limits, 
and I try to break past them every single day.
Definitely won't be disappointed if given a chance to work together.

Best regards

If you're looking for a programmer who's an expert in python programming, I am glad you've come to the right place.
