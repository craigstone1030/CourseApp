I have created the above stores from scratch where i designed these stores using Photoshop, did HTML/CSS Frontend work and then converted the final apporved design into Shopify liquid template/theme.

======

I think that I did well on my similar. I got on well with other people and really enjoyed working with them.

Design without collaboration is like darts with a blindfold. We love communication and try to make sure that we have a clear understanding of what you'd like your project to look like. We always provide proofs, and meet together to discuss feedback. We include 2 rounds of revisions with every design project that we take on, and are happy to negotiate more. We also make it a point to design within the parameters of Shopify so that the building process goes smoothly and requires as little additional work as possible.

Describe your approach to testing and improving QA
==============

I do manual QA testing. I test the website on various browsers and devices for functionality, design, and responsiveness. Also use automated scripts to test forms, carts, checkout, subscriptions, payment gateway, etc, and test the website on GTmetrix and Google Pagespeed for further speed improvements.

I set up three copies of the site and maintain the repositories with-

Production
Development
Testing

==========

Approach for testing and improving the QA include:

- Manual testing of functionality.
- Pixel Perfection of all the designed pages. There are many tools that I used often to test the sites.
- All Support Devices or Fully Responsive styels- In this approach, I used to test the site for responsiveness on at least 5 devices that I have- iPAD, IPHONE, TAB, MACBook, Window Laptops, Desktop with high resolution screens. So while testing on these devices, I check the responsive work.
- Site Speed- In this Approach, I tried to test the sites for google Speed insights, GTMatrix, IwebCheck and many other. Based on the reports, I fixed the possible issues'

=========

When completing the work, the developer looks over what they've done before turning it in as complete. Then the Project Manager looks over it to make sure that it matches your specific requests. Finally, a strategist will look over the project to make sure that the project was completed the best way from a technical/strategic standpoint. Once it's passed all three of these inspections, the project manager will send it to you for your review.

========

When working on a client project, each new page we build is then tested on desktop / android / iphone to ensure the design mockups are translated successfully and that all page elements' functionality/responsiveness works as it's supposed to.

==========

To realize the shift-left approach, involve the development team in the quality assurance process and have them perform regular code reviews and unit testing. Then, let the test team take over and perform manual and automated testing activities at the application's API and UI levels.

=========

Develop tests cases during the requirements phase

Automating repetitive tasks allows the test teams to focus on other important tasks and maximize their efficiency.

Dedicating testers to certain aspects of the software ensures that each area has someone’s complete attention. Test management helps to identify and reduce issues quickly

===========

As I have a team of 20+ designers and developers in the house, we work in a managerial and disciplined manner. So before delivering the project, I will confirm and test your website with QA, and then we will deliver the website to you

=========

I ensure that QA is done at each step of the project- design, front end and after backend development. Also responsiveness is checked across all major devices and browsers. Issues are noted on a google document and once the team resolves, the QA team performs another analysis to ensure it has been fixed

========

Our QA process
* Review of requirements
* Test planning/writing test cases
* Unit testing
* Integration testing
* System testing
* Performance testing
* Security testing
* Cross-browser testing / cross-platform testing
* Updating test cases
* Regression testing

==========

I am experienced in VAPT and have cleared many security audits with companies like EY while working on projects. I follow stringent parameters to comply with VAPT. However, as a developer, I might not be able to do complete justice to testing. Normally for most projects, I have worked with testers from the very start who writes the test cases and executes those once my development is complete.

==========

It is extremely important to ensure that the website does not crumble under the pressure of many users browsing it. Testing must be done to include SQL injection, cross-site scripting, spoofing, and password cracking on the website.

For improving the QA, We need to define, measure, and improve quality. We need to analyze the system of the problem;
and develop a hypothesis on which changes (solutions) might improve quality.

============

Manual Testing
Automation Testing

1. Involve the QA team in sprint/iteration planning
2. Identify potential regression early on
3. Identify the need for test automation
4. Design a test data management strategy
5. Regularly update test design documentation
6. Take a shift-left approach to testing

=========


To realize the shift-left approach, involve the development team in the quality assurance process and have them perform regular code reviews and unit testing. Then, let the test team take over and perform manual and automated testing activities at the application's API and UI levels.

==========

I have a proactive approach in testing and improving QA, where I start testing from the design phase, Hence, I try to make the testing as effective as possible as it greatly helps in saving time and catching bugs.

Further more start with the QA by preparing Test Plan in the beginning & Identifying the scope of testing, preparing the test environment. implementing the automation testing wherever its required & Preparing the documents properly to check whether we are going as expected.
