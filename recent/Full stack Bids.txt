The first challenge I faced was the problem with authorization. I quickly managed to eliminate it and ensure high quality. And the next challenge was the issue with analytics. Since analytics is as important as the performance of a solution, I did everything possible to make sure that my clients get all the data and can analyze it effectively.


I use react functional component with hooks, write clean code, use comment for coding, code immutable and functional way, use lodash , make reusable code, make custom hooks if needed, optimise code etc. I would be really good fit for this project as I can develop high performance MERN app.

==================== React expert bid =========================

Hello

I have been working as a React engineer for over 5 years, and during that time I specialized in React Hooks, Redux for state management, and its related libraries & packages.
I'm also proficient in integrating REST APIs and writing unit & e2e tests.
When it comes to UI libraries, I'm well-versed in Material-UI, AntD, and so forth.
While having a strong knowledge of React.js, I also have extensive experience with NodeJS frameworks especially Express.js.

Would you mind looking at my React(TypeScript) projects?
https://app.coinswap.space/
CoinSwap Space is a decentralized exchange or DEX created for swapping BEP20 tokens on the Binance Smart Chain.
The main challenge was making updates to an existing legacy platform that was difficult to maintain, support and improve due to its architecture, underlying technology and design.
Most of the original code was refactored to make it more modular & reusable, and wrote form-based pages to dynamically change as data was entered and REST API was queried.
Also, working as a front-end engineer, my goal was to implement interactive pages and functionalities to enhance platform stability and security.

https://nexusnotes.com - An online notes upload website , Backend architecture designed by me

https://www.architecturaldigest.in/ - An Editorial application built on React.js. Frontend is architect-ed by me including UI/UX

https://delightiq.com/- An online booking portal for a client in Mauritius. (Backend Architect-ed by me)..

https://www.aurumfit.com/ - An online fitness platform ..I was involved i FE (Built from Scratch)

==============================Bid 5 MERN=============================

Hello,

I am a senior MERN stack developer with hands-on experience in React.js, Node.js and their ecosystem.
Working as a full-stack developer, I have worked on many successful bug-free web app development projects using React.js, Node.js and etc for eCommerce, data visualization and etc.

Here are some technologies I often use:
- State management of UI components individually or globally using: Redux, Mobx, Flux
- RESTful API integration using: Redux-Thunk, Redux-Saga
- Responsive UI development using: Styled components, Material UI, Antd design
- Shared components development using: Storybook
- Unit test for UI side using: Jest & Enzyme
- Back-end API development using: Node.js, Express.js, Koa.js
- Database development using: Mongoose.js, Sequelize.js, Knex.js
- Unit test for Node.js modules, services, endpoints and etc using: Mocha & Chai

Here are some examples of my works:
https://www.wehaveanyspace.com/en/ (AirBnB-like platform for commercial real estate)

Since analytics is as important as the performance of a solution, I did everything possible to make sure that my clients get all the data and can analyze it effectively.

The Human Rights Campaign is the go-to information resource for LGBTQ people and allies worldwide.
Technologies: 𝙈𝙀𝙍𝙉(𝙈𝙤𝙣𝙜𝙤𝘿𝘽/𝙀𝙭𝙥𝙧𝙚𝙨𝙨.𝙟𝙨/𝙍𝙚𝙖𝙘𝙩.𝙟𝙨/𝙉𝙤𝙙𝙚.𝙟𝙨) 𝙨𝙩𝙖𝙘𝙠, 𝙈𝙖𝙩𝙚𝙧𝙞𝙖𝙡-𝙐𝙄, 𝙏𝙖𝙞𝙡𝙬𝙞𝙣𝙙 𝘾𝙎𝙎
Solution: I worked with the design team, and they provided me with unified design files they produced for HRC. Based on it, I built the website for them using 𝙈𝙀𝙍𝙉(𝙈𝙤𝙣𝙜𝙤𝘿𝘽/𝙀𝙭𝙥𝙧𝙚𝙨𝙨.𝙟𝙨/𝙍𝙚𝙖𝙘𝙩.𝙟𝙨/𝙉𝙤𝙙𝙚.𝙟𝙨) 𝙨𝙩𝙖𝙘𝙠 and 𝙈𝙖𝙩𝙚𝙧𝙞𝙖𝙡-𝙐𝙄. In final step of this project, my role also involved front end side modification using 𝙏𝙖𝙞𝙡𝙬𝙞𝙣𝙙 𝘾𝙎𝙎.

Building state-of-the-art, easy-to-use, user-friendly websites and applications is truly a passion of mine. I actively seek out new technologies and stay up-to-date on industry trends and advancements. I can provide a clean code and a professional approach to work.

I focus on making my code scalable and always stick to the rules and language syntax. At the same time, I'm an out-of-the-box thinker and capable of finding a solution for a non-typical task.
