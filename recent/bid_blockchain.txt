Nothing is too much trouble =  I am always ready to help!

=============Overview======================
Hello.
I am a software engineer and I have been working as a developer for 9 years.
I have knowledge of Full Stack Web Development but I prefer to Specialize in Blockchain and Smart Contracts Development Technologies.

I have great experience working on N.F.T.s Projects and Platforms. If I accept to work in your Project Full-Time, 
I will work exclusively on it. I always prefer to establish long-term business relationships with Clients when possible.

I can help you with the Development and Modification on Ethereum/Polygon/B.S.C. of Smart Contracts in Solidity like Ethereum ERC-20/B.S.C. BEP-20 Tokens. N.F.T.s (ERC-721/ERC-1155) either Single or a whole Collection with its own Generative ArtWork and MetaData, Minting, Selling, Pre-Sale, I.C.O. Smart Contracts and more!!!

My Skills Include:
✅ Blockchain: Solidity, Truffle Suite, Hardhat, Web3.js, Ethers.js, Open Zeppelin Library, Unit Testing(with Mocha & Chai) and IPFS Client
✅ Web: Net Core, C#, Node.js, React.js, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript
✅ Frameworks: Nhibernate, WCF, ADO.Net, Entity framework, Nunit, Telerik, Redux, Typescript
✅ Database: SQL Server, MySql
✅ Tools: Jira, Trello, Slack, Confluence
✅ Methodologies: Scrum, Kanban

Last year I took several courses to improve my knowledge in blockchain, such as: Dapp University, Crypto Zombies, Eat The Blocks, HashLips NFT, and Ethereum Blockchain Developer Bootcamp With Solidity (Udemy).

I feel very comfortable teaching things to others and could even lead teams in the future. 
I am very ambitious and curious and I am continually learning new things.

Let's discuss
Thanks

================= smart contract review ==========================

https://www.nanopass.io/

The smart contract is located at:
https://etherscan.io/address/0xf54cc94f1f2f5de012b6aa51f1e7ebdc43ef5afc#code


Solidity version could be 0.8.10
import “./Ownable.sol”; could be replaced with opezeppelinOwnable
import “./@rarible/royalties/contracts/LibRoyaltiesV2.sol”; doesn’t work on opensea, a bit useless
All this
address public constant DEV_ADDRESS_1 = 0xc73ab340a7d523EC7b1b71fE3d3494F94283b4B1; // J
address public constant DEV_ADDRESS_2 = 0x09b2741feD63B7Fcc5E577cDc9d0cf0D85127A32; // P
address public constant DEV_ADDRESS_3 = 0xC929b6bD739a8564BcB35e978Afe4ffF5b6c3cEF; // R
address public constant DEV_ADDRESS_4 = 0x5bF9BE0B32ba09B449eD5d1EaBB864Cf2317629F; // D
address public constant DEV_ADDRESS_5 = 0x3e8f4639E926f36f7309836F6D018a9ea59B345e; // H
address public constant DEV_ADDRESS_6 = 0x5bB1396E3EC5E31E12DC7846c4c94eea25083f35; // L
address public constant DEV_FUND_ADDRESS = 0x7955cF321a420f7c245cEfB748E0F303756Ae2A6;
are used here
uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
require(balance > 0, “Balance is 0”);
payable(DEV_FUND_ADDRESS).transfer(balance * 5000 / 10000);
payable(DEV_ADDRESS_1).transfer(balance * 1666 / 10000);
payable(DEV_ADDRESS_2).transfer(balance * 1229 / 10000);
payable(DEV_ADDRESS_3).transfer(balance * 805 / 10000);
payable(DEV_ADDRESS_4).transfer(balance * 900 / 10000);
payable(DEV_ADDRESS_5).transfer(balance * 200 / 10000);
payable(DEV_ADDRESS_6).transfer(address(this).balance);
could be replaced with PaymentSplitter for a MUCH clearer view of where the money flows
5. require(numberOfMints * price <= msg.value, “Amount of ether is not enough”);
I would replace ≤ with ==. so I don’t have to handle refunds after
6. function airdrop(address[] calldata addresses) external onlyOwner {
should include a check to not allow more than 50 addresses or risk going out of gas
7. missing contractURI method
8. They seem to limit from the dapp the gas limit to 102,543 (a usual mint is 80,653). I would let the wallet calculate so I don’t scare users with too much $$$ showed there.


 =================  NFT generation =====================

Awesome!!!
This project is best match for my skills
I have rich experience in NFT generation from the layers.
At that time, I created NFT and metadata based on the layers
How many NFTs do you want?

No problem.
