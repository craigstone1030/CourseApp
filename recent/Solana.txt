Dear Client !

---I am ready to your technical verification---
Your job really caught my eyes.
I'm posting this proposal after read your job description very carefully.

I have rich experiences in solana chain
I have experiences in spl-token creation, FTX exchange platform for Dex, Metaplex candy machine for nft-minting site and nft marketplace on solana chain.
I am familiar with anchor-web3 and rust program for smart contract, and i'm ready to be tested from you.

As a full stack blockchain dev, I developed project with C#,Vue.js and React/Next.js
This is a NFT minting site with total supply, 7777 NFTs developed by me on solana chain
Actually i have completed this project within 10 days and sold 3333 nfts for 2 days.
The cost to complete this project is as follows:
1. For creating CM --> 13 sol
2. For uploading 7777 images on arweave --> 17.5 sol
3. For completing total project --> 31-32 sol
This minting site has many functions such as a NFT art generator(deciding rarity, generating arts randomnessly), setting minting price per a NFT item.
============ My Skills ============
Frontend: React
Backend: Node.js or Next.js
Blockchain: Solidity
============ My experience for NFT marketplace ==============
1. Create an environment, Ubuntu 20.04
2. Install solana and metaplex binaries
3. Use an NFT generator to create metadata and jpegs
4. upload metadata and jpegs to storage (arweave in this guide)
5. Create CANDY MACHINE with the metadata you generated
At this point, the admin can mint
6. Set start time for candy machine to allow users to start minting
At this point, users may mint
7. If you have a UI, users may then click “mint” and they get the token

I can complete frontend+backend+smart contracts 100% successfully within a short period.
I also developed NFT-Art-Generator.
Let's discuss more details in chat.
I will look forward for your reply.
Thanks.
