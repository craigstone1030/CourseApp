I have been working as a full stack web developer since 2012. 

During this time, I've been developing websites and web applications of various complexity for industries including education, real estate, 
finance, e-commerce and others. 

I am a self-motivated and self-taught professional who likes to solve problems, suggest smart architectural solutions and build advanced 
visually appealing user interfaces.

I worked at Apico company at the Senior Full Stack JavaScript Developer position. My responsibility is to write well maintainable and 
organized code, perform research activities, resolve technical problems and provide assistance to other developers in our team. 
I am well experienced in building high-performing web apps with an emphasis on system scalability, speed and high load resistance.

I have huge experience in JavaScript frameworks such as Vue.js, React, Next.js, Nuxt.js.

Especially, I am familiar with Vue.js than others because it  combined the top-level features of React and Angular, 
but its main feature is the perfect user experience. Also, it leveraged the capacity of the virtual DOM and optimized the code structure.

I prefer using the PostgreSQL database, however in specific cases (for
example blogs, personal pages, etc.), I use the NoSQL alternatives (MongoDB, DynamoDB).
