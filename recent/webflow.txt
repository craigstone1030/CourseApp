Dear sir,
I am posting the proposal now after fully getting your scope understood. Now, saying 100% surely, I can do it, no problem technically.
I have been designing/developing Webflow websites for more than 5 years.  
I will convert your provided design or prototypes or mockup into Webflow which will be clean, responsive, 
and pixel-perfect.

Webflow is a drag and drops site builder without design limitations. 
Besides that, there are so many 3rd party jQuery plugins or custom javascript that can be integrated to extend 
the features your website needs. 
Webflow allows creating custom attributes for HTML elements that can be necessary if you want to add custom javascript 
or jQuery plugins. I have vast knowledge in extending features and integrating custom plugins.

Webflow also allows creating CMS for any listing content like blogs. It also allows the creation an e-commerce website.

Please check my previous projects made by web flow.

Hi
I  have huge experience in webflow development.
Webflow is a no code web design tool invented for visual web design. It can be used for designing responsive websites, landing pages, eCommerce sites, blogs, and more. Beyond a web design tool, it also has CMS (content management system), and it's also a hosting platform.

I have been extensively working with Bubble.io for the last 4 years and also have created more than 30 web projects with Bubble.io.

As a full stack developer, I have huge experience in Chrome extension development

I am familiar with Web3.js and Three.js for creating metaverse.

I can start right now and work full time in your time zone.
After finishing this project, I am open to offer FREE AS SERVICE including beta features.
