I have been working incessantly providing services to clients globally, and have always been great at handling high-stress situations. Aside from what I can produce creatively, my strengths include good communication skills, rational thinking, and a nascent inclination towards hard work.

As a talent fullstack blockchain developer, mastered in Solidity
I specialized in Ethereum, Solana smart contracts for minting with special features 
such as presale, burn, white/black listing & royalties. 


Major skills are following

7 year ago on 3rd Oct, have got to know first time what smart contract is and from it have been exploring and working on same. Being a Computer engineer, have started my career as an MNC Server developer but left after 2 years as it didn't excite me much, so I went for another exciting thing, i.e. freelancing in Mobile app, which was good and lucrative but still had fewer challenges. Now while searching something new came across to the crypto world; this was new and exciting. First did the understanding, then paid and then developed.
i.e

First, read and learned about the same, then participated in coin transaction, currently world-first crypto Mutual fund managed with total holding on $500K user money to invest and then started developing. Have played a key role in some ICO launches, token launches and getting the same register on big exchanges.


However, in the last 3 years, the NFT world and marketplace have changed the whole view of games, learned the smart contract in more detail, working with the crypto world, open sea SDK and then made own marketplace.

Currently having experience in developing own market place with fewer gas fees setup, royalty setup, random image generation and another similar setup in same. Below are a set of expertise, holding now and working on same as per the need of the project.

---TASK------
ok here you go, I really hope this makes sense to you!? (and is possible for you to do!)

Please note: I am not a developer/programmer so I will try to explain what I want to the best of my ability (but sometimes I may use the incorrect terms).

Currently:
- We have a basic website built on Wordpress: https://metaracers.net
- We have a basic single-player racing game that is a Wordpress plugin (php & javascript): https://metaracers.net/wildkats-arcade-racing/ 
Users can log in and play the racing game, their score for each level is stored in a MySQL database (Wordpress), and we have a leaderboard that displays the highest scores.
- Finally, we have 10,000 WildKats NFTs that are currently being minted here: https://talis.art/collection/61d7103cfa67286afa4c6088

Next steps:
I want to move away from Wordpress, so the first thing would be to create a React app as the new front end where we will host the tournaments. I am hoping we can connect the React app with the game and/or Wordpress DB (I am open to your ideas on how best to make this work, REST API maybe?).
Assuming we can connect the React App with the Wordpress game, I want to build the below tournament infrastructure:

1. web3 connect
- User connects to the App with Terra wallet.
- User plays the game and their score is stored in the db (maybe a new db?). Importantly it needs to store the score for the user's wallet that is connected.

2. tournament smart contract infrastructure
Create tournament logic that has the following parameters:
-- tournament type (we will have 2 types of tournament = leaderboard or knockout)
-- entry price
-- prize pool split 
-- payout structure 
-- start time
-- end time
-- number of rounds
-- maximum players
-- minimum players

An example "leaderboard tournament" would work like this:

Admin-user creates a new tournament and sets the below parameters:
-- tournament type = leaderboard
-- entry price = $10 UST
-- prize pool split = 80% to player prize pool, 10% to NFT owners, 10% to MetaRacers
-- payout structure = 30% to winner, 15% to 2nd place, 10% to 3rd place etc. etc. (we will set up a payout structure table based on number of entrants)
-- start time = 12pm UTC-- end time = 2pm UTC
-- number of rounds = 4 (with each round lasting 30 minutes i.e. ((end time - start time) / number of rounds).)
-- maximum players = unlimited
-- minimum players = 8

- Players connect their wallets and pay $10 UST to enter the tournament.
- The smart contract distributes the $10 UST as per the prize pool split (80% to player prize pool, 10% to NFT owner pool, 10% to MetaRacers pool).
- Players are registered to the tournament
- Players are randomly assigned a WildKat NFT for the tournament
- Tournament starts at the start time with Round 1. The Player has 30 minutes to play the game and register scores into the database.
- After the end of Round 1, the top 50% of Players (top scores) will advance to Round 2. The remaining Players (bottom 50% of scores) are eliminated from the tournament.
- The same process repeats for Round 2 and Round 3. In the final round, Round 4, the winners are decided and the prize pool $UST is distributed to the winning players as per the payout structure percentages.
- The NFT owner prize pool is distributed to the NFT owners

An example "knockout tournament" would work like this:

Admin-user creates a new tournament and sets the below parameters:
-- tournament type = knockout
-- entry price = $10 UST
-- prize pool split = 80% to player prize pool, 10% to NFT owners, 10% to MetaRacers
-- payout structure = 30% to winner, 15% to 2nd place, 10% to 3rd place etc. etc. (we will set up a payout structure table based on number of entrants)
-- start time = 12pm UTC
-- end time = 2pm UTC
-- number of rounds = 4 (with each round lasting 30 minutes i.e. ((end time - start time) / number of rounds).)
-- maximum players = unlimited-- minimum players = 8

- Players connect their wallets and pay $10 UST to enter the tournament.
- The smart contract distributes the $10 UST as per the prize pool split (80% to player prize pool, 10% to NFT owner pool, 10% to MetaRacers pool).
- Players are registered to the tournament
- Players are randomly assigned a WildKat NFT for the tournament
- Players are randomly paired against each other in head-to-head battles
- Tournament starts at the start time with Round 1. The Player has 30 minutes to play the game and register scores into the database.
- After the end of Round 1, the winning player in each head-to-head battle progresses to the next round. The losing player from each battle is eliminated from the tournament.
- The same process repeats for Round 2 and Round 3. In the final round, Round 4, the winners are decided via the leaderboard method and the prize pool $UST is distributed to the winning players as per the payout structure percentages.
- The NFT owner prize pool is distributed to the NFT owners
