Hi! What business sector does your project belong to?

My recent project was BAAR - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1msArw98Qtcjs6zENtRL6zuNYyNqhwA--/view - an application for native German speakers that allows to produce status reports of the work done by a particular business unit, and to generate annual work plans. We've implemented the role allocation according to the access matrix. There are 3 types of users: Admin, Manager, and Viewer. Admin creates new users and sends them e-mail invitation with a generated password to log in (can be changed later).The frontend is based on React JS 16.12.0, TS 3.8.2, Redux 7.1.3. The backend is based on Node JS, Express, PostgreSQL, Redis, Sequelize. There is a wide range of high load technologies applied and here I worked with Socket.io for working with websockets, Handlebars for making up an html file for a report, Wkhtmltopdf for converting html to pdf, Docx for docx file generation, Jsonwebtoken for JWT token generation, Nodemailer for sending emails. Hosting: Docker.

I am interested in collaboration and although I'm with mentalstack.com, there is still an option of direct communication. Let's schedule a call to discuss the details. When are you available?

Hope to talk to you soon.

==================== React expert bid =========================

Hello

I have been working as a React engineer for over 5 years, and during that time I specialized in React Hooks, Redux for state management, and its related libraries & packages.
I'm also proficient in integrating REST APIs and writing unit & e2e tests.
When it comes to UI libraries, I'm well-versed in Material-UI, AntD, and so forth.
While having a strong knowledge of React.js, I also have extensive experience with NodeJS frameworks especially Express.js.

Would you mind looking at my React(TypeScript) projects?
https://app.coinswap.space/
CoinSwap Space is a decentralized exchange or DEX created for swapping BEP20 tokens on the Binance Smart Chain.
The main challenge was making updates to an existing legacy platform that was difficult to maintain, support and improve due to its architecture, underlying technology and design.
Most of the original code was refactored to make it more modular & reusable, and wrote form-based pages to dynamically change as data was entered and REST API was queried.
Also, working as a front-end engineer, my goal was to implement interactive pages and functionalities to enhance platform stability and security.

üìå My Main skills are the rapid development and precision to the details that really makes me different from others.

üìå Communication is one of the most important things in remote working, and I always keep daily updates to during the project & test upon completion.

I can start working right now with more than 40 hours of availability in your time zone, so feel free to contact me anytime.

Now I'm a part of the Roonyx team of developers, and we can guarantee code quality and a structured approach in the development and overall business management. Scrum and Jira are the tools that we work with, as we focus on productivity in all aspects.

Here is a couple of examples that I wanted to share, based on the stack you require:
- Tys - a web-based app for booking appointments in salons, it scrapes data from a number of salons so the users can filter the result based on time, location, and a type of service
https://www.experiencetys.com

- SponsorOne - a MarTech app for promoting brands through social media.
https://sponsorsone.com/

I'd be happy to listen to your scope of tasks and get more details regarding the project you guys work on. Can we arrange a quick meeting for a discussion? When are you available this week?
