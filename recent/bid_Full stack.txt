Hi! What business sector does your project belong to?

My recent project was BAAR - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1msArw98Qtcjs6zENtRL6zuNYyNqhwA--/view - an application for native German speakers that allows to produce status reports of the work done by a particular business unit, and to generate annual work plans. We've implemented the role allocation according to the access matrix. There are 3 types of users: Admin, Manager, and Viewer. Admin creates new users and sends them e-mail invitation with a generated password to log in (can be changed later).The frontend is based on React JS 16.12.0, TS 3.8.2, Redux 7.1.3. The backend is based on Node JS, Express, PostgreSQL, Redis, Sequelize. There is a wide range of high load technologies applied and here I worked with Socket.io for working with websockets, Handlebars for making up an html file for a report, Wkhtmltopdf for converting html to pdf, Docx for docx file generation, Jsonwebtoken for JWT token generation, Nodemailer for sending emails. Hosting: Docker.

I am interested in collaboration and although I'm with mentalstack.com, there is still an option of direct communication. Let's schedule a call to discuss the details. When are you available?

Hope to talk to you soon.

==================== React expert bid =========================

Hello

I have been working as a React engineer for over 5 years, and during that time I specialized in React Hooks, Redux for state management, and its related libraries & packages.
I'm also proficient in integrating REST APIs and writing unit & e2e tests.
When it comes to UI libraries, I'm well-versed in Material-UI, AntD, and so forth.
While having a strong knowledge of React.js, I also have extensive experience with NodeJS frameworks especially Express.js.

Would you mind looking at my React(TypeScript) projects?
https://app.coinswap.space/
CoinSwap Space is a decentralized exchange or DEX created for swapping BEP20 tokens on the Binance Smart Chain.
The main challenge was making updates to an existing legacy platform that was difficult to maintain, support and improve due to its architecture, underlying technology and design.
Most of the original code was refactored to make it more modular & reusable, and wrote form-based pages to dynamically change as data was entered and REST API was queried.
Also, working as a front-end engineer, my goal was to implement interactive pages and functionalities to enhance platform stability and security.

📌 My Main skills are the rapid development and precision to the details that really makes me different from others.

📌 Communication is one of the most important things in remote working, and I always keep daily updates to during the project & test upon completion.

I can start working right now with more than 40 hours of availability in your time zone, so feel free to contact me anytime.

Best regards

Technologies: 𝙈𝙀𝙍𝙉(𝙈𝙤𝙣𝙜𝙤𝘿𝘽/𝙀𝙭𝙥𝙧𝙚𝙨𝙨.𝙟𝙨/𝙍𝙚𝙖𝙘𝙩.𝙟𝙨/𝙉𝙤𝙙𝙚.𝙟𝙨) 𝙨𝙩𝙖𝙘𝙠, 𝙈𝙖𝙩𝙚𝙧𝙞𝙖𝙡-𝙐𝙄, 𝙏𝙖𝙞𝙡𝙬𝙞𝙣𝙙 𝘾𝙎𝙎
Solution: I worked with the design team, and they provided me with unified design files they produced for HRC. Based on it, I built the website for them using 𝙈𝙀𝙍𝙉(𝙈𝙤𝙣𝙜𝙤𝘿𝘽/𝙀𝙭𝙥𝙧𝙚𝙨𝙨.𝙟𝙨/𝙍𝙚𝙖𝙘𝙩.𝙟𝙨/𝙉𝙤𝙙𝙚.𝙟𝙨) 𝙨𝙩𝙖𝙘𝙠 and 𝙈𝙖𝙩𝙚𝙧𝙞𝙖𝙡-𝙐𝙄. In final step of this project, my role also involved front end side modification using 𝙏𝙖𝙞𝙡𝙬𝙞𝙣𝙙 𝘾𝙎𝙎.

Building state-of-the-art, easy-to-use, user-friendly websites and applications is truly a passion of mine. I actively seek out new technologies and stay up-to-date on industry trends and advancements. I can provide a clean code and a professional approach to work.

I focus on making my code scalable and always stick to the rules and language syntax. At the same time, I'm an out-of-the-box thinker and capable of finding a solution for a non-typical task.
