I had utilized some of the advance features of Vue.JS, which was used in my recent applications and some of the attributes, are listed below:

• Had used In-built Composition API to improve the quality of the code by allowing decouple features of the logic
• Sharing features via standard JavaScript/Typescript patterns instead of inventing new ones
• Built components and allowed the new API to co-exist with the Options API, without replacing it
• Provided more flexible code organization and logic reuse capabilities to make the code easy to understand and reuse with the help of Composition API
• Worked well with Typescript, two way data binding and OOPs principles in Vue.JS-3
• Used Reactivity to effectively read and write the property directly with the usage of “.value”
