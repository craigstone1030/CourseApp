Hi! I have a thing for Angular. Why? I realized it's really something while I have been tackling Angular for last 6 years, not to mention a dozen projects I have built with it. AngularJS/Angular is a big daddy of all SPA frameworks, but this is NOT the reason why I adore it. What I like most about Angular is, it's mature and all-in-one. Angular is practically everything you may need, no matter whatever you are going to build.

You know, whoever says that Angular is slower and has larger bundles than React or Vue is merely a beginner and does not understand that React or Vue is not mature and need other dependencies to do something Angular can do alone. It's not that React and Vue are not good, but Angular has more cool stuffs.

So, I have every concept of Angular under my belt - not only built-in ones such as module/module lazyload, routing, component, directive, service, resolver, guard, interceptor, template driven form & reactive form but also advanced techs such as rxjs, ngrx, Angular universal & prerender, and Angular PWA & service worker configuration & offline mode support. And I have worked with quite a few UI frameworks that are based on Angular or that are compliant with Angular such as Angular material, ngx-bootstrap, Prime NG and TailwindCSS.

I can start immediately and strictly adhere to the deadlines and guidelines. I would like to speak with you about my role in more detail.
Looking forward to hearing from you regarding next steps.
