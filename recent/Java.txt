Hi

After coming across your senior full stack Java developer job description on Upwork, I was immediately sure I wanted to apply. 
With my master’s degree in computer science, more than 7 years of software development expertise, and recent experience with Java in the fintech industry, 

I believe I could make a great fit!

Over the past six years, I’ve amassed extensive experience in Java development while building building full stack web applications 
with foundations in Java 8+ with Spring Boot, Angular, and DB2. I have in-depth, hands-on knowledge of Hibernate, RDBMS, SQL, object oriented programming concepts, 
event-driven systems (Kafka), and containerized applications (Docker/Kubernetes). 

On a day-to-day basis, I currently have senior-level responsibilities, including leading design workshops, performing code reviews, supporting production, 
and liaising with product owners and other stakeholders. Given how well my background and skill set match what you're looking for, 
I think I am a strong possible candidate. 

I’d truly appreciate the chance to speak with you further on the senior full stack Java developer role. Thanks in advance for considering my application, 
and I look forward to hearing from you! 

Regards
