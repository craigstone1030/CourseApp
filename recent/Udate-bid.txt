---web---
Dear Client!

I have 8 years experience using React & React native.
Usint these technologies I completed and deployed 23 web projects.
Some of them are
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiloo.subwaysurf
https://mightymongooses.com
https://wagmimark.io
https://undeadpastelclub.io
https://www.creepz.co
I've completed these website and apps myself.
Please concentrate on the website mightymongooses.
I feel that it's very wonderful. You can find me as  Hiro as a full stack developer in their team members. It's NFT mint service so I've completed both of its Dapp and service.
Sorry but I can't share all of my previous projects because I've already signed NDA with my clients. I hope you will understand my mind.

Using hook we can make the source shorter and clener as same functions than traditional react compoent class with function component and compinated lifecycle methods such as useEffect.

So I'd like to explain about it in my words. are you okay?
I don't like to explain in following any other's technical articles or directions. I always understand technical points as my style and try to explain about it in my words.

React hook has some advantage features than traditional react. Of course over 16.8 versions of react is called react hook.
In react hook we can make the projects shorter and cleaner than lower versions using function components and combined life-cycle methods such as useEffect.
For example useEffect is combined some previous life-cycle methods such as compoentWillMount and componentWillRecvProps.

Many thanks and Regards
